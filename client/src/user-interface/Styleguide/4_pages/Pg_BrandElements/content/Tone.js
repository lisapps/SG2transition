                The Kingston tone of voice should embody our core values. It should create an
                emotional connection with the customer and use the ‘Kingston Is With You’ concept as
                a starting point. With each piece of communication consider where Kingston products
                are in that situation, the different touch-points of that technology with the
                customer, and how they may interact and feel when using the Kingston product. This
                will ensure that the copy is always relevant, engaging and true to each situation.

                  <p>
                    Where possible the copy should be benefit-led, and headlines should talk about
                    the real life benefits to the end-user. This will ensure that the copy and
                    messaging is always relevant and interesting to the target audience, and give
                    more information than generic headlines and copy.

                  <p>
                    The copy needs to be simple, straightforward and direct to allow for any
                    translations that may be needed. It should not use colloquialisms. It needs to
                    instill trust in Kingston products, solutions and services. Copy shouldn’t be
                    frivolous or silly.

                  <p>
                    It needs to relate to real-life situations and speak from a place of knowledge
                    and experience. With over 30 years experience, Kingston is an authority and can
                    communicate with honesty and confidence.

                    <br />
                    The copy should reinforce that Kingston Is With You and always there for you.

                  <p>
                    It needs to be accessible to each audience and use an appropriate level of
                    technical information for the audience. The level of technical know-how will be
                    different depending on the products, applications and audience.

                  <p>
                    This ensures the tone of voice can be tailored for each audience. e.g. It can be
                    more technical when used in flyers and HTML pages for Data Center products aimed
                    at an IT audience and more consumer oriented, fun and engaging for B2C products.

                  <p>
                    It should be honest and confident and let the products, solutions and services
                    speak for themselves. Kingston talks about our success and the quality of our
                    products, solutions and services, but isn’t arrogant or egoistical.

                The overall Kingston tone of voice is the same across all communications. However,
                there are some differences between brand, B2B and B2C communications.

              <h3 className="u-txt-bold">Brand</h3>
              <p>
                The messaging should embody the brand values, with a focus on the ‘Kingston Is With
                You’ tagline. The communications should put Kingston in situations that are
                relevant, sometimes surprising, engaging and interesting to the customer. The tone
                of voice should be short, punchy, exciting and energizing.

                The B2B communications are more technical in their content and execution. Kingston’s
                style should convey honesty, confidence and authority to B2B customers. It includes
                the benefits, of our products, customer applications, problem solving and cost
                savings (TCO).

                The B2C communications should be interesting, sometimes surprising, always relevant
                and never boring. The tone of voice for B2C communications needs to be
                plain-speaking and approachable.

                Keep things light and conversational, short and punchy, wherever you can. Be witty

                ensures that it’s engaging and fresh.
